1. HTTP: set of rules for internet communication	

2. What we type in our browser consists of several parts: protocol + hostname + port + resource	+ query

3. A DNS takes hostnames and turns them into IP Adresses

4. An argument passed on to the end of the url consisting of key value pairs and example would be what gets added when you do a search in the search bar on a website. 

5. GET and POST; you use get if you are making a request without side effects and post if you are trying to change something on the server. 

6. That's what your browser sends to the server when trying to get something back

7. This is the response from the server to your browsers request. 

8. Headers contains information about the data to be fetched / the data that is returned. An example is the language header. 

9. Follows the http protocols to turn somesite.com into an IP address, connects to this IP Address using port 80 for http, requests /some/page.html


**Part 2** I don't know where to use curl and dig tired dig in vs code and curl in my terminal and nothing happened. Also If I open the page with live server and change the method to POST anything I enter crashes it.
